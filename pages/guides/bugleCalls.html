                    <h3>History of Bugle Calls</h3>
                    <p>Every evening at 1700, soldiers, family members, and civilian employees honor the nation while continuing a tradition
                        as old as the US Army. Cars stop, work pauses, and everyone renders honors to the flag.</p>

                    <p>George Washington first assumed command of the Continental Army in 1775. Drums and bugles were already a fixture of
                        military life. They allowed commanders to communicate orders amidst firing muskets, clashing sabers, and booming
                        cannons. Frontier outposts used bugle calls to coordinate tasks like gathering forage or returning from work
                        details.</p>

                    <p>Days began early, with soldiers feeding and grooming horses before dawn. Following <strong>Reveille</strong>,
                        breakfast was served, and <strong>Assembly</strong> signaled inspections. The Soldier with the best uniform often
                        served as the commander's orderly.</p>

                    <p>Afternoons were spent on fatigue duties, returning to camp when <strong>Recall</strong> was sounded, leading to
                        evening parade and <strong>Retreat</strong>. Frontier soldiers attended final parades, and prior to the 1890s,
                        <strong>Tattoo</strong> signaled lights out at 2200, along with Sunday inspections.
                    </p>
