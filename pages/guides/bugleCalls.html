                    <h2>Bugle Calls</h2>
                    <p>Bugle calls are used to communicate commands and signal activities during Civil Air Patrol
                        events. Some calls are not observed in CAP but are part of military tradition.</p>

                    <h3>History of Bugle Calls</h3>
                    <p>Every evening at 1700, soldiers, family members, and civilian employees honor the nation while
                        continuing a tradition
                        as old as the US Army. Cars stop, work pauses, and everyone renders honors to the flag.</p>

                    <p>George Washington first assumed command of the Continental Army in 1775. Drums and bugles were
                        already a fixture of
                        military life. They allowed commanders to communicate orders amidst firing muskets, clashing
                        sabers, and booming
                        cannons. Frontier outposts used bugle calls to coordinate tasks like gathering forage or
                        returning from work
                        details.</p>

                    <p>Days began early, with soldiers feeding and grooming horses before dawn. Following
                        <strong>Reveille</strong>,
                        breakfast was served, and <strong>Assembly</strong> signaled inspections. The Soldier with the
                        best uniform often
                        served as the commander's orderly.
                    </p>

                    <p>Afternoons were spent on fatigue duties, returning to camp when <strong>Recall</strong> was
                        sounded, leading to
                        evening parade and <strong>Retreat</strong>. Frontier soldiers attended final parades, and prior
                        to the 1890s,
                        <strong>Tattoo</strong> signaled lights out at 2200, along with Sunday inspections.
