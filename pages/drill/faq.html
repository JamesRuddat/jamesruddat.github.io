                            Command"?</button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> These are two different types of commands used in drill.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Preparatory Command:</strong> The first part of a command that tells you
                                    what movement is about
                                    to happen.
                                    <br>Example: In <em>“Right, FACE”</em> — the word <em>“Right”</em> is the
                                    preparatory command.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Command of Execution:</strong> The second part that tells you when to
                                    actually move.
                                    <br>Example: In <em>“Right, FACE”</em> — the word <em>“FACE”</em> is the command of
                                    execution.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Supplementary Command:</strong> A command given by a subordinate leader
                                    (like a flight
                                    commander) to relay or adjust the main command so their element can execute it
                                    properly.
                                    <br>Example: When the squadron commander calls <em>“Squadron”</em>, each flight
                                    commander repeats
                                    <em>“Flight"</em>.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <button class="faq-question">How many paces do you take when executing “Open Ranks,
                            March”?</button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>
                                The distance depends on the rank:
                                <br><strong>1st rank:</strong> 3 paces forward
                                <br><strong>2nd rank:</strong> 2 paces forward
                                <br><strong>3rd rank:</strong> 1 pace forward
                                <br><strong>4th rank:</strong> Stand fast (no movement)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This applies regardless of how many ranks are present. For example, with only two ranks,
                                the 1st rank takes 3 paces and the 2nd rank takes 2 paces.

                                how many members are in a rank. Drill instructions and spacing are based on official
                                manuals, not informal

                            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a complex drill command that requires element
                                leaders to give supplementary commands to their elements for the next movement (e.g.,
                                "Forward" or "Column Right/Left").
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Element leaders must wait until the preparatory command is called before issuing
                                    their commands.</li>
                                <li>They then give precise supplementary commands and execute the movement exactly as
                                    instructed.</li>
                                <li>Assistant element leaders should <strong>not</strong> call out "last man" or add
                                    notes. Element leaders
                                    visually check their sub-element members over their right or left shoulder to ensure
                                    everyone is aligned correctly.</li>
                                <li>This ensures smooth execution and adherence to the drill manual without unnecessary
                                    verbal cues from assistants.</li>

                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> When given the “Rest” or “At Ease” command, cadets should
                                <strong>keep their right foot planted</strong> and may relax their upper body. They
                                do <strong>not</strong> need to copy Parade Rest movements, as it is not required.

                                    officer</strong>. Always use respect and good judgment when rendering a salute.</p>

                            <p><strong>This is incorrect.</strong> The First Sergeant is a visual guide for alignment,
                                but you should not use them to measure exact steps. Always rely on proper spacing and
                                alignment techniques rather than counting steps from the Flight Sergeant.</p>
