                    <h2>Open Ranks Inspections</h2>
                    
                    <p><strong>FALL IN:</strong> The Flight Commander assumes attention and gives the command:
                        “Column of Files from the Left, Forward.” Element leaders respond with “Forward” or “Stand Fast” as appropriate. The
                        first element moves to a designated location and commands “Element, Halt,” with other elements following in
                        sequence.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Sizing and Counting Off:</strong> Flight commanders ensure cadets are lined up by height (excluding element leaders and
                        flight sergeant), using shoulder taps to move cadets forward as needed. After alignment, cadets count off in quick time while
                        element leaders call out numbers over their right shoulder.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Inspection:</strong> Squadron and Flight Commanders prepare flights by giving commands like “Open Ranks,
                        March,” and ensure alignment using visual cues. Cadets follow element leaders' commands precisely during the
                        inspection. Commands like “Ready Front” are used to return to attention.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Dismissing the Flight:</strong> After inspection, the Squadron Commander commands “Squadron, Attention” and
                        Flight Commanders take charge, executing “Close Ranks, March” and briefing the flight about inspection results.
                        Cadets return to their classroom or designated area in formation.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Left flank is squared off with extra cadets filling from fourth to first element.</li>
                        <li>The Flight Sergeant is always the last cadet in the fourth element.</li>
                        <li>Commands are executed precisely; element leaders relay commands to their cadets.</li>
                        <li>Cadets should never measure steps using the First Sergeant; alignment is visual.</li>
                    </ul>
